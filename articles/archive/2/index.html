            <h1>My personal philosophy to combat my mental illnesses</h1>

            <h6>
                    Mental illness can be soul crushing, disruptive, demotivating and so much more….
                    <br><br>
                    I am sure that if you or your loved one has suffered or is suffering through mental illness you will be well are aware of how horrible it can get.
                    <br><br>
                    To start, I should disclose my mental illnesses, unfortunately my philosophy might not work well enough with your mental illness but I will try my best, I am suffering from Clinical Depression, Generalized Anxiety, Obsessive thoughts, Suicidal tendency, Hypochondria, Anankastic Personality Disorder(OCD), Suicidal thoughts, Panic attacks and some phobias.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are interested in the psychology behind this, here is my big 5 results:
                    <br><br>
                    <br>
                    Extroversion — 16
                    <br><br>
                    <br>
                    Neuroticism — 42
                    <br><br>
                    <br>
                    Agreeableness — 30
                    <br><br>
                    <br>
                    Conscientiousness — 22
                    <br><br>
                    <br>
                    Openness — 50
                    <br><br>
                    <br>
                    This is based on the big 5 theory, you can take the survey yourself here — <a>https://psychcentral.com/personality-test/</a>
                    <br><br>
                    Scoring low on the Extraversion scale tells us that I am — introverted, feel exhausted from when I have to socialize a lot, dislike to be the center of attention, find it difficult to start conversations, carefully thinking and considering before speaking, dislike small talk.
                    <br><br>
                    Scoring high on neuroticism scale tells us — express a lot of stress, worry about many different things, get upset easily, feel anxious, experience dramatic shifts in mood.
                    <br><br>
                    Scoring High on Agreeableness scale tells us — have a great deal of interest in others, care about others, feel empathy and concern for other people, enjoy helping and contributing to the happiness of other people.
                    <br><br>
                    Scoring low on Conscientiousness scale tells us — dislikes structure and schedule, procrastinate important tasks, make mess and not take care of things, fail to complete the things I am supposed to do.
                    <br><br>
                    Scoring High on Openness scale tells us — very creative, open to trying new things, happy to think about abstract concepts, focused on tackling new challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    Often times I find myself devoid of motivation to do anything, let alone confronting my problems head on, I’ve been in deep depression for 3 years now in a row, never had a day where I haven’t been confronted by my depression, I am medicated with Seroxat( Paroxetine As Hydrochloride, an anti-depressant), but more than often my depression is quite strong anyway, but without medication its much much worse, so if you have not consulted with a psychiatrist about medical intervention, I highly recommend you do so, sometimes it can be an easy fix, while other times partially working, not to mention that you have to try several medications to figure out what works best for your body, but it is worth the time and effort in my estimation.
                    <br><br>
                    I also found out that I lost perception of time, since when you are depressed and anxious you tend to shrink your timeframe more and more by the day, it is a survival mechanism that says “there is something wrong right now! Do something!”, it also helps to cope with certain things that you rather not think about, for example future implications of such behavior in the long term.
                    <br><br>
                    I found it easier to not act on anything that will make my life better just because I would have suffered the temporary consequences of those actions, which also helped my motivation go down and accept my current fate, its self-destructive and demotivating.
                    <br><br>
                    I often times could not function properly and think clearly when the obsessive and suicidal thoughts accour, effectively impairing my cognitive abilities, which I hold on a high pedestal ever since I was a child I wanted to understand how things work and behave, I cannot go a day without intellectual stimulation, and that depressed me even more.
                    <br><br>
                    The combination of these factors created a closed loop that produced more and more depression, negative and suicidal thoughts, making the situation even worse by the minute.
                    <br><br>
                    My timeframe went from years to minutes, I accepted my unholy fate and decided to stop trying to get better.
                    <br><br>
                    I am lucky to have a loving and caring family that supports me and tries to help me get on my feet no matter how bad it is, later on I also discovered Dr. Jordan B Peterson, a terrific clinical psychologist and professor of psychology, he stimulated my intellect and made me think about things from a different way, from a psychological and philosophical lens, before that my lens was distorted by depression and anxiety, making my world view rather poor and murky, at that time I also have been steadily (but ever so slowly) progressing in my psychological treatment (3 years now), all these factors gave me just what I needed to begin my transformation, my rebirth, just like the phoenix, if I may use Petersons archetypal term (I quite like his use of these seemingly universal myths to describe very real and personal conditions).
                    <br><br>
                    Now equipped with a new and refreshing lens to view my world and situation, I could start to put things back into perspective, first thing I needed to do, was accept the situation, accept reality for what it was, I was in a very dark place mentally, and if I did not do anything about it, my future would be even worse than hell itself, I decided to mentally list the things that will become worse, I’m sure anyone of us knows what’s wrong in our lives and being able to predict how things will evolve, for better or worse.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I reflected on myself on a deeper level I put the worst thing that can happen to me was death, but after really thinking about it, death isn’t as scary as the consequences that would unfold on the way to it, this changed my mind from “death will free me” to “it would be really narcissistic and ignorant of me to die and make things even worse than they already are”, that was the point where my whole mental process went upside down, from nihilistic self-destructive thinking I went to something I would refer to as “holly shit I need to make things better no matter the cost”.
                    <br><br>
                    Both you and i know that making yourself do anything at any time is impossible, and I was well aware of that, not to mention the other mental illnesses that made that even harder, I needed some philosophical principle or rule that would be sufficient enough to tilt my initial response to engaging in a task instead of instant discard of it.
                    <br><br>
                    After many and I mean many days of thinking, I figured out how I could do that, and keep in mind that this is my personal solution, you might have to find your own version or rule that will tilt that instant response from yourself, my rule was “if it requires 2 or less minutes to finish, I might as well do it as I will only suffer for 2 minutes or less, it could be the most intense suffering and pain I could ever feel, but I know that I can survive 2 minutes of it”.
                    <br><br>
                    With this in mind I could in a way trick myself to do a small task, and there’s plenty of stuff you can do that require 2 minutes of your time, believe me, pick any task with a positive outcome, meaning — choose a task that if you have completed it, you will be a slightly better version of yourself then yesterday.
                    <br><br>
                    For me the first small task would be to brush my teeth, it only takes a few minutes and the suffering is minimal to none, don’t give up trying if you didn’t go up and do that task, if you keep telling yourself that you want to go and do something, eventually you will, and with time it will develop a tendency to engage in it unconsciously.
                    <br><br>
                    Keep on finding small tasks to do, even if they aren’t directly involved in your mental well-being, the more you see yourself actually completing tasks that you set for yourself to do, you will get your confidence back in small amounts, giving you small boosts to conquer bigger and bigger tasks, from spending a whole month applying this philosophical and psychological framework I could gain enough confidence that I could start to try to solve bigger problems that I had.
                    <br><br>
                    I have phobias that are related to needles, blood, medical intervention, I knew I needed to get blood tests done and start to recover my body from 3 years of total shut in depression, before my mental illnesses worsened I had been very physical, I did judo, parkour, basketball, so I went from a fit person to a shut in depressed hopeless guy stuck in his room for 3 years with no fitness upkeep, this made my body feel weak, because it was slowly getting weak from insufficient physical activity, this in turn activated my inner hypochondriac, at first I just thought that something was wrong, that I was going to die, but in fact, I was just out of shape…
                    <br><br>
                    With this in mind I could put my fear of doing the blood work to something tangible, for the first time I was able to define my phobia, and when you can define something you are afraid of, often times you find that you have no real reason to be afraid of it, or at least be more afraid of the consequences of not confronting the fear itself then the actual fear, this way I was able to put a clear label and a flow chart that will tell me exactly what will happen.
                    <br><br>
                    So, with my rule in mind I could tell myself something like this “the suffering of 2 minutes of the blood test are indeed real and can be a little painful, but letting my health stay like this will result in far worse suffering, hence I should go and do it no matter the physical pain”, and indeed I did, I am still wrapping my head around my ability to have shut off my background noises that were blaring in my head, keep calm, at least calm enough, to let the nurse do the procedure with no unnecessary complications, and when I walked out of that room, I knew I was not hopeless anymore, I knew that I stood up to my fears and illnesses, and I survived, that I am the captain of this ship, that I could still change the trajectory of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    And since then I have confronted another problem that I thought I was incapable of solving, and one after another, it only reinforced my new knowledge that yes, yes I can actually change my life, and actually can minimize unnecessary suffering from my and my family lives.
                    <br><br>
                    I still have some background noise every day, but I am able to successfully silent my worries and fears to be able to continue and pursue my goals in life.
                    <br><br>
                    And after a while of doing this I was able to go from my 2-minute rule to “the temporary suffering I will endure in a task are not as bad as the hell that would come if I don’t endure it”.
                    <br><br>
                    And just like my fears and anxieties, my timeframe stretched from minutes to months, to years, I am now planning to pursue my academic passion, which would be psychology, neuro psychology, biology, chemistry and some robotics on the side.
                    <br><br>
                    I hope this personal story and philosophy can help you in any way, best of luck,
                    <br><br>
