            <h1>Social Justice Warrior Ignorance Pathology</h1>

            <h6>
                Subscribers of social justice warrior ideology, more than often ignore any ideas or factual conclusions that go against the core of their ideology, be it correct or not, are creating a lethal echo- chamber that is not only typical of ideological movements, but also is creating an environment in which the ideology itself cannot be criticized and therefore cannot be updated, remodeled or discarded.  
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                This kind of herd mentality, alongside ignorance to criticism and lack of self-reflection, is not only counterproductive, but potentially lethal to their own causes, which on the surface and in theory are perfectly reasonable, though misguided in their action as a group.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                In these troubling times of political and ideological divide in our current world seems to be amplified by each side putting their ideologies, morals and ethics on the pedestal, making it impossible to debate and test their validity without the accusation of ignorance, bigotry or any other seemingly malicious agenda that goes against the ideological narrative.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                This self-defense mechanism amplifies and polarizes these ideological groups even further, making it even harder to critic or engage in a meaningful conversation and debate, this in essence means that no natural external correction process can occur, or to put it in simpler terms, blocking their ideology from the option to evolve naturally through interaction with reality.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                It seems to be the case that most subscribers of social justice ideology seem to be incapable of separating between themselves and the ideology, in fact making any attack on their ideology an attack on them, this results in a psychological self-defense process, making them even more ignorant to anything said towards them, all the while responding with aggressive accusations of reprehensible behavior that would instantly validate their position, regardless of context or reality, claiming higher morals.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                The trend of labeling any critics of the ideology of the social justice warrior with reprehensible labels seem to be both a self-defense mechanism while also a deception tactic to appeal to the spectator that is unaware of the underlying pathology that is accruing, the spectator will think that the accused is indeed as reprehensible as the label itself and will side with the social justice warrior at first, seemingly airing on the side of justice, unaware of the true nature of such pathology.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                The spectator, even when he comes to know the pathology, will often comply with the demands of the social justice warrior, as it might put him in seemingly negative light at shallow level of analysis, while being complex in its nature, is unappealing to the public, it seems that modern society won’t put up with the idea as it is complex and often times counterintuitive in a sense, they prefer the shallow and short ideology, as there is no need to engage in complex problem solving, be it from the lack of free time or the denial of the need of complex problem analysis and solution making.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                Furthermore, the social justice warrior will be satisfied with simple generalized solutions to complex problems mainly because of the chance that complex analysis will reveal a possible solution that will go against their ideologically driven morals and ethics, as we previously established the strong connection between the ideology and the social justice warrior self-perception, will feel as if the solution itself contradicts their own existence, making the social justice warrior even more ignorant, dismissive and resentful.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                The Social justice warrior ideology seems to be inspired in part by the Marxist ideology, the parallels include, but not limited to, a vision of an utopia where everyone is equal under the law, a single uncorrupt entity to oversee the populous and its behavior, the meddling in what freedoms a citizen can act upon.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                The obviously contradictive ideologic belief and western morals provides even more basis to the pathology that is prevalent in the midst of the social justice warrior crowd, the inability to see inherent contradictions between authoritarian principles that their ideology provides to western values that give us the freedom to speak our minds and the freedom to act as you wish as long as no harm is done to a fellow human being.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                The insistence to police the speech of the citizen is Orwellian beyond belief, there will be no free press if we will tag along this crusade of sanitizing our language from controversial or impolite words, effectively creating subjects that by law, will be prohibited from conversing and debating about, in short, creating sacred cows that cannot be touched, and if provoked, will result in a legal action against you.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                The argument that the typical social justice warrior will throw upon you for such thing is that if we don’t police certain words, they will be used to discriminate or hurt a fellow person, this can be shown to be false by pointing that the west has written and enacted laws that prohibit any form of discrimination against a fellow person on any characteristic other than his own ability, in fact the social justice warrior seems to advocate to discrimination laws, by giving special privileges to certain minorities, in essence, creating discrimination to the non-special privileges population, in this instance the white skinned person, knowing well enough that we have enacted laws that prohibit any discrimination against any form of racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                It seems to be that the social justice movement became so pathological it has clearly lost all sense of direction and reality, it has been shown to be a dangerous echo-chamber that will result in the corruption of the western democracy and its morals, while claiming higher ground and inclusivity.
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h6>
                To combat the up-rise of extremist ideologies we need to handle problems in a multi-level analysis of complex problems and converse with a diverse range of opinions and ideologies to see which potential solutions stand the trial and scrutiny from all possible directions.
            </h6>
