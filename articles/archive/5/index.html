            <h1>Left vs Right, Which one to choose?</h1>

            <h6>
              If you have either answered Right! or Left!, you are wrong, there is no right decision here, politics are complicated, and so are the people.  
              <br><br>
              if you did answer the question, you are engaging in group mentality on some level, you put the group identity and principles before your own.
              <br><br>
              black and white answers to complex political and social issues is blatantly anti-intellectual ,ignorant and childish.
              <br><br>
              black and white decisions and actions are the leading cause of radicalization and divide in our current social and political landscape.
              <br><br>
              people will generalize and discard any person that holds any opinion that goes against their affiliation or principles, creating an echo-chamber that disregards opposing and different opinions.
              <br><br>
              this leads to both sides to hate each other even more then before, since both sides think that the other isn't willing to listen to them.
              <br><br>
              both the right and left agree on four things (for the sake of my argument):
              <br><br>
              *freedom of speech
              <br><br>
              *freedom of action
              <br><br>
              *the democratic process
              <br><br>
              *universal basic human rights
              <br><br>
              if you cant agree on this four, i am afraid i don’t know what will.
              <br><br>
              freedom of speech is the fundamental right that enables any one of us to express our opinions and ideas, without the threat of censorship or harm, there will be no free press if there is no freedom to speak, be it correct or not, free press is crucial to a modern society that seeks to find the truth.
              <br><br>
              freedom of action, we can all agree that a person should not be blocked from acting on any action as long as it doesn't result in harm of another person.
              <br><br>
              (do not mistake this right with the right to not to be offended, that is protected by the first principle, freedom of speech, as long as it isn't blatant hate speech, it should not be censored).
              <br><br>
              the democratic process, democratic elections of a candidate (or party of candidates) that will oversee and manage the state.
              <br><br>
              a person should have all of his universal basic human rights, this makes sure the state cannot harm,violate or prosecute the individual without a proper civil procedure, this makes sure that the right for fair trial is protected and the right from discrimination on any basis will be protected (among many other basic human rights).
              <br><br>
              both the left and right can agree on this western principles, start from here and evolve to conversing about harder and more complex issues that emerge in our modern day life.
              <br><br>
              there is no single solution for a problem, and that is the problem that seems to bother both radical sides, they are hellbent on applying their version of the solution on society, that is not how democracy works, we need to consider all possible solutions and converse, debate and argue, for and against those solutions, the best and most compromised solution will emerge, and compromise is not a bad thing, it is the fundamental way we work with each other, we cannot force change and should not, as it will only lead to more polarization and hatred.
              <br><br>
              it is time that our politicians and the public need to understand that without cooperation from both sides our society will just crumble into chaos, it isn't a black and white world, and so aren’t the solutions for it.
              <br><br>
              we need to engage in very hard conversations, and i am not looking forward for those, nobody does, nobody wants to confront hard and painful things, but unfortunately needed to progress society and peaceful conversation, we clearly have to, and we have to be civil and understanding of the other side, reflect on our own opinions and principles to make sure there is no echo-chamber that is preventing compromise to happen between ideas.
              <br><br>
              my answer to this question would be:
              <br><br>
              be an individual and follow your heart, but don’t let it grow cold, consider others to have a valid opinion that needs to be investigated before any conclusion can happen, only this way we can heal as a society and make proper decisions that will effect the future for the better.
