            <h1>New Cancer “Vaccine” Eliminates Cancer tumors in mice study</h1>

            <h6>
                On January 31, 2018, Stanford University School of Medicine has released an article explaining of new possible treatment against cancer tumors in mice, including those that arise later on in the life cycle of these genetically engineered mice that develop cancer tumors.
                <br><br>
                The new method involves the reactivation of cancer-specific T cells by injecting micro-gram amounts of two agents directly into the tumor site.
                <br><br>
                The first agent being a short stretch of DNA known as CpG oligonucleotide, which works in congestion of other nearby immune cells to amplify the expression of an activating receptor called OX40 which resides on the cancer T cells.
                <br><br>
                The second agent being an antibody that binds to the activating receptor OX40 which is located on the cancer T cells, this activates the T cells to charge against the cancer cells.
                <br><br>
                This method differs from previous methods by the fact that the agents are injected directly into the tumor, only injected T cells activate, making them recognize only cancer-specific proteins.
                <br><br>
                In some cases, these tumor-specific activated T cells leave the original tumor to combat and destroy any other tumor that is identical to the original one (the recognized cancer-specific proteins) throughout the whole body.
                <br><br>
                87 of 90 mice were cured from cancer, meanwhile 3 had their cancer reoccur, after a secondary treatment the cancer has regressed in those mice too.

                                “This is a very targeted approach,Only the tumor that shares the protein targets displayed by the treated site is affected. We’re attacking specific targets without having to identify exactly what proteins the T cells are recognizing.”

                      </blockquote>
                <br><br>
                The current clinical trial is expected to recruit about 15 patients with low-grade lymphoma. If successful, Levy believes the treatment could be useful for many tumor types. He envisions a future in which clinicians inject the two agents into solid tumors in humans prior to surgical removal of the cancer as a way to prevent recurrence due to unidentified metastases or lingering cancer cells, or even to head off the development of future tumors that arise due to genetic mutations like BRCA1 and 2.

                        <p class="mb-0">
                                “I don’t think there’s a limit to the type of tumor we could potentially treat, as long as it has been infiltrated by the immune system,”

                Unlike conventional cancer treatments, like chemotherapy which work by killing the cancer before the patient often times, is able to kill cancer tumors without effecting the patient, and even lowering the likelihood of reoccurring cancer.
